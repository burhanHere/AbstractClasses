# AbstractClasses Project

This project demonstrates the use of abstract classes in C#. It includes an abstract `Employee` class and two derived classes, `Accountant` and `Assistant`, to illustrate polymorphism and abstract method overriding.

## Classes

### Employee

`Employee` is an abstract class that defines the properties and methods common to all employees.

#### Properties
- `Name`: Gets or sets the name of the employee.
- `Salary`: Gets or sets the full salary of the employee.

#### Abstract Methods
- `CalcSalary()`: Calculates the salary after deductions.

### Accountant

`Accountant` is a class that inherits from `Employee` and provides its own implementation of the `CalcSalary` method.

#### Methods
- `AccountantSalary()`: Returns the full salary.
- `CalcSalary()`: Overrides the `CalcSalary` method to calculate the salary after a fixed deduction.

### Assistant

`Assistant` is a class that inherits from `Accountant` and overrides the `CalcSalary` method to apply a different deduction.
